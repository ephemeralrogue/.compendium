<h2 align="center">Overview</h2>

There are innumerable design resources out there, and almost as many 
repositories ennumerating them. The Design Compendium will take the classic 
README-style resource list and provide a frontend for the quick perusal of 
resources by category.

This project is currently designed to be forked and utilized on a personal 
basis, as deployment of the official frontend will not occur until funding 
makes deployment plausible. you can read about it 
[here](https://blog.ephemeralrogue.xyz/the-design-compendium).

This is being produced and maintained by 
[ephemeralrogue](https://github.com/ephemeralrogue) 
for LVNACY. Any questions regarding this repository and any contributions 
should be directed there.

with regard to the general development of what currently exists here:


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
